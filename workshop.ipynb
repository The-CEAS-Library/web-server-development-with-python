    "# Python Web Server Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Web Server?\n",
    "- Physically: A computer/machine that runs server software that delivers information to those who request it (clients)\n",
    "    - Information can be data (JSON, primitive data), webpages, files, etc\n",
    "- Software: Software that supports HTTP and is used to communicate to clients through an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an API?\n",
    "- Application Programming Interface\n",
    "- Mediator between users/clients and resources\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a REST API?\n",
    "- Representational State Transfer\n",
    "- Set of design principles\n",
    "- https://www.ibm.com/topics/rest-apis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why make a Web Server with an API?\n",
    "- Serve data to a client\n",
    "- Example: [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-users-id-tweets)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Client? \n",
    "- Website that runs on a user's browser\n",
    "- Desktop app\n",
    "- Mobile app\n",
    "- Anything that would request data from a server\n",
    "\n",
    "## Request Lifecycle\n",
    "- A client sends a request (looks like a URL)\n",
    "- Requests have a request method and are navigating to an endpoint, and may have query, path, or body parameters\n",
    "    - Request Method: indication of desired action\n",
    "    - Endpoint: An end of a communication channel. Each endpoint of an API has a different function/purpose\n",
    "    - Query Parameters: Variables we may send as part of our request\n",
    "    - Path Parameters: A modification to the URL that changes the behavior of the request\n",
    "    - Body Parameters: Sending a large volume of data (usually in JSON format)\n",
    "- Request travels to the server of the API\n",
    "- Server receives the request on a specific endpoint, and given inputted data generates a response ie. calculation or database query\n",
    "- Server sends response back the the client.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is FastAPI?\n",
    "- Python package used for building a web server\n",
    "- Built on top of Flask, another popular web server framework\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing and running\n",
    "- In your terminal/command line:\n",
    "- `pip install -r requirements.txt\"`\n",
    "- `uvicorn main:app --reload`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first command installs all of the needed packages for the workshop. These are defined in the file `requirements.txt`. Within `fastapi[all]`, `uvicorn` is included.\n",
    "- `uvicorn` is a web server package that we can use to start our API. Adding `--reload` means that when we save `main.py`, our server is restarted with the new code.\n",
    "- Within `main.py`, there is the line `app = FastAPI()`. This is telling uvicorn that we are using FastAPI for our API via `main:app`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test your first endpoint\n",
    "- Endpoint: A communication channel that an API allows access through\n",
    "- Open your browser\n",
    "- http://localhost:8000/\n",
    "\n",
    "## What exactly did we just do? \n",
    "- Our FastAPI code started a webservice on port 8000\n",
    "- When we hit a URL in our browser, we send a GET request to the service that lives at that URL\n",
    "- So, when we go to http://localhost:8000/ we made a request to the endpoint \"/\"\n",
    "- That endpoint returns a JSON which is shown to us\n",
    "\n",
    "### The building blocks of writing an endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "![\"/\" endpoint](./workshop_resources/hello_world.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSON\n",
    "- JavaScript Object Notation\n",
    "- Very common format used in a variety of languages, *is not* exclusive to JavaScript\n",
    "- Key-value pair system\n",
    "- Keys are strings\n",
    "- Values are strings, numbers, lists, or another object\n",
    "\n",
    "## Request methods\n",
    "- Outlines the behavior of the endpoint\n",
    "- Common types\n",
    "    - GET: retrieve data\n",
    "    - POST: add new data\n",
    "    - PUT: update data\n",
    "    - DELETE: remove data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Swagger\n",
    "- Built into our web server is a way for us to test our endpoints\n",
    "- http://localhost:8000/docs\n",
    "- When we add new endpoints, they show up in here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query Parameters\n",
    "- Often, we have to send additional data along with our request that will define how we want the function to behave.\n",
    "- query paramters are a key-value pair system to send data\n",
    "- We use ? to start our list of params\n",
    "- Given `x=y`, x is the key and y is the value\n",
    "- We use the & to separate our params ie `?foo=bar&x=y`, order of params provided doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![endpoint with a query param](./workshop_resources/query.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- This endpoint would return \"Hello {name}\" given a name\n",
    "- To hit this endpoint, go to http://localhost:8000/hello?name=[replace with your name]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guided Example 1: Fibonacci Endpoint\n",
    "- In helpers.py there exists a `fib` function\n",
    "- For `fib` of `n`, return that value of the Fibonacci Sequence\n",
    "- Write an endpoint that serves this function\n",
    "- The endpoint should take a parameter that is used to call `fib` and return the answer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1: Compound Interest Endpoint\n",
    "- In helpers.py there eixsts a `compound_interest` endpoint that calculates an Annually Compounded interest\n",
    "- Given a `principal`, `rate`, and `tenure`, this function returns the total amount owed. \n",
    "- Write a GET endpoint called `/interest` that takes 3 parameters, 1 for each of these inputs, and returns the Annually Compounded interest\n",
    "\n",
    "## Request Body\n",
    "- Often we need to send data that is not easy to represent in a key value pair ie a list or nested object structure\n",
    "- Or the data can be very high volume\n",
    "- For this, we can send a JSON to an endpoint that allows it for it to be parsed\n",
    "\n",
    "![endpoint with a body param](./workshop_resources/body.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because the parameter of the function is validated with a class, FastAPI will look for a body\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guided Example 2: \n",
    "- Let's imagine we are building a simple social media app. We are going to design a system where a user can sign up with a username, password, and a list of their interests\n",
    "- There is an empty dictionary at the top of the file called `user_db` that will serve as our \"database\"\n",
    "- Write an endpoint called `/user` with a POST request for creating a user with this data\n",
    "- The input data is delivered through a JSON\n",
    "- The key in the db should be the username, the value should be the rest of the values from the input\n",
    "- Return the data of the new user\n",
    "- Use the class in `models.py` to validate the input\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2: \n",
    "- Let's imagine we are creating a to-do list app, and we want our items to be synchronized across our devices so we are going to put data on a server\n",
    "- There is an empty dictionary at the top of the file called `todo_db` that will serve as our \"database\"\n",
    "- Write an endpoint called `/todo` with a POST request for creating a todo with this data\n",
    "- The input data is delivered through a JSON\n",
    "- The key in the db should be the name of the todo, the value should be the rest of the values from the input\n",
    "- Return the data of the new todo\n",
    "- Use the class in `models.py` to validate the input\n",
    "\n",
    "## Path Parameters\n",
    "- We can also directly use the path of our URL to change our request's behavior\n",
    "- When we wrap a part of our path with {}, this data is passed into our request's function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![endpoint with a path param](./workshop_resources/path.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dark blue part of the path in the first line is directly passed into the function when it's called\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guided Example 3: \n",
    "- Let's add a way for a user to look up their username\n",
    "- Create a GET endpoint called `/user/{username}`\n",
    "- Query our db for the user\n",
    "- Return the found user, but make a deep copy of the returned object and remove the password from the response first!\n",
    "- At the top of the file, add `from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse`\n",
    "- Use the following if the user can't be found: `return JSONResponse(status_code=404, content={\"message\": \"User not found\"})`\n",
    "- Test your endpoint by adding a user with the previous guided example's endpoint and then getting the data with this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3\n",
    "- Let's add a way for a user to look up their todos\n",
    "- Create a GET endpoint called `/todo/{name}`\n",
    "- Query our db for the todo\n",
    "- Return the found todo\n",
    "- At the top of the file, add `from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse`\n",
    "- Use the following if the todo can't be found: `return JSONResponse(status_code=404, content={\"message\": \"Todo not found\"})`\n",
    "- Test your endpoint by adding a todo with the previous exercise's endpoint and then getting the data with this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4\n",
    "- A user should be able to see all of their todos at once\n",
    "- Write a GET endpoint called `/todo` that returns the entire `todo_db` object.\n",
    "- Test your endpoint by adding several todos with the POST `/todo` and retrieve them with this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
